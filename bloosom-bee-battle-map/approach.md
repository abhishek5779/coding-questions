### **1. Problem Understanding**
- **Input**:
  - `n1`: Number of flowers in Lily's garden.
  - `flowers`: A list of integers representing the quantities of flowers in Lily's garden.
  - `n2`: Number of herbs in Rose's garden.
  - `herbs`: A list of integers representing the quantities of herbs in Rose's garden.
- **Output**:
  - A list of flowers that Lily should note down, preserving the order in which they appear in her garden.
  - If no flowers meet the criteria, output `-1`.

- **Criteria**:
  - For each flower in Lily's garden:
    - If the flower exists in Rose's garden, Lily notes it down only if its quantity in Lily's garden is greater than its quantity in Rose's garden.
    - If the flower does not exist in Rose's garden, Lily notes it down.

---

### **2. Approach to Solve the Problem**

1. **Count the Frequencies**:
   - Use two `map<int, int>` (or hash maps) to count the occurrences of each flower in Lily's garden (`lilycount`) and each herb in Rose's garden (`rosecount`).

2. **Iterate Through Lily's Flowers**:
   - For each flower in Lily's garden:
     - Check if the flower exists in Rose's garden (`rosecount.find(flowers[i])`).
     - If it exists, compare the counts:
       - If Lily has more of that flower than Rose has herbs, add it to the result list.
     - If it does not exist in Rose's garden, add it to the result list directly.

3. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - If no flowers meet the criteria, return `-1`.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Print the flowers that Lily should note down, preserving their order.

### **3. Complexity Analysis**

#### **Time Complexity**:
1. Counting frequencies:
   - \(O(n1)\) for `lilycount`.
   - \(O(n2)\) for `rosecount`.
2. Iterating through `flowers`:
   - \(O(n1)\) for comparisons and lookups in `rosecount`.
3. Total: \(O(n1 + n2)\).

#### **Space Complexity**:
1. `lilycount` and `rosecount`:
   - \(O(k1 + k2)\), where \(k1\) and \(k2\) are the number of unique elements in `flowers` and `herbs`, respectively.
2. `results`:
   - \(O(n1)\) in the worst case.
3. Total: \(O(k1 + k2 + n1)\).
